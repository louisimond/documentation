The Kalla AI API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You need to include your API key in the header of each request you make to the API.

## Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Log in to your Kalla AI account at [https://app.kallaai.com](https://app.kallaai.com)
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" page
3. Click on the "Create new API Key" button
4. Copy your new API key and store it securely

<Warning>
  Keep your API key confidential and secure. Do not share it publicly or commit
  it to version control systems.
</Warning>

## Using the API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Example Request

Here's an example of how to include the API key in a cURL request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kallaai.com/api/user/campaigns" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key when making requests.
